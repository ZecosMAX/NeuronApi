# NeuronApi

Not really an API, but a well-made neuron toy for myself
You can specify a lot of things, starting from count of neurons for layers 
to custom activation function of every single neuron out there

please, fell free to use this code ^_^

And since i'm very interested in machine-learning, and especially deep-learning (and stuff)
this code is very likely to be updating, to perform different types of problems.

And of cource no license or copyright will be provided, but i'll appreciate, if you
mention me if you'll use my code.
But if you don't, I'm don't really mind about that
